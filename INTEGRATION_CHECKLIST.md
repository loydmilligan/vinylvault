## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Quick Test with Demo Page
```bash
# Navigate to static directory
cd /home/mmariani/Projects/vinylvault/static

# Serve demo page (Python 3)
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Or with Node.js
npx serve .

# Open http://localhost:8080/demo.html
```

### Test Features in Demo
- [ ] Responsive grid layout at different screen sizes
- [ ] Touch gestures (swipe on mobile/touch devices)
- [ ] Vinyl button animation (click Random button)
- [ ] Lazy loading (scroll to see skeleton loading)
- [ ] Theme toggle (bottom-right button)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (R for random, / for search)
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh (on touch devices)

### Integration Test with Flask App
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Start Flask app
python3 run.py

# Test in browser at http://localhost:5000
```

## 📱 Device Testing

### Recommended Test Devices
- [ ] **Raspberry Pi with 7" touchscreen** (primary target)
- [ ] **Desktop browser** (Chrome/Firefox)
- [ ] **Mobile phone** (iOS Safari/Android Chrome)
- [ ] **Tablet** (iPad/Android tablet)

### Performance Validation
- [ ] First Contentful Paint < 1.8s on Pi
- [ ] Smooth 60fps animations
- [ ] Responsive touch feedback < 100ms
- [ ] No layout shifts during loading
- [ ] Memory usage stable during long sessions

## 🔧 Customization Options

### CSS Variables (style.css)
```css
:root {
    --accent-primary: #ff6b35;     /* Brand color */
    --spacing-md: 16px;            /* Base spacing */
    --touch-target: 44px;          /* Touch size */
    --transition-base: 0.25s;      /* Animation speed */
}
```

### JavaScript Configuration (app.js)
```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    TOUCH_THRESHOLD: 50,           /* Touch detection */
    SWIPE_THRESHOLD: 100,          /* Swipe distance */
    VINYL_SPIN_DURATION: 2000     /* Vinyl animation */
};
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**1. CSS not loading**
- Check Flask static file serving is working
- Verify `url_for('static', filename='style.css')` generates correct path
- Ensure static directory exists and has proper permissions

**2. JavaScript errors**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify app.js is loading without syntax errors
- Test VinylVault namespace is available globally

**3. Touch gestures not working**
- Verify touch device detection
- Check viewport meta tag is correct
- Test on actual touch device (not mouse simulation)

**4. Slow performance on Pi**
- Reduce animation duration in CSS variables
- Check for memory leaks in browser dev tools
- Verify hardware acceleration is enabled

**5. Vinyl animation not playing**
- Check SVG loads properly
- Verify CSS animations are enabled
- Test on different browsers

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging:
```javascript
// In browser console
window.VinylVault.debug = true;
```

## 📋 Production Deployment

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] Test all features on target Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Verify performance metrics meet requirements
- [ ] Check accessibility with screen reader
- [ ] Test offline functionality
- [ ] Validate responsive design at all breakpoints
- [ ] Confirm touch gestures work on Pi touchscreen

### File Permissions
```bash
# Ensure static files are readable
chmod 644 /home/mmariani/Projects/vinylvault/static/*
```

### Browser Caching
Consider adding cache headers for static assets in production:
```python
# In Flask app
@app.after_request
def add_header(response):
    if request.endpoint == 'static':
        response.cache_control.max_age = 31536000  # 1 year
    return response
```
