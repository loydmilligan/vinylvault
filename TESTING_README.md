## Production Deployment Validation

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All unit tests pass (95%+ pass rate)
- [ ] Integration tests complete successfully
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Docker containers build and start correctly
- [ ] Database migrations complete

- **Security**: Input validation and error handling
- **Reliability**: Error recovery and graceful degradation

## Test Data & Fixtures

### Mock Data Structures

- **Sample Albums**: Realistic Discogs API responses
- **User Configurations**: Various setup scenarios
- **Performance Datasets**: Large collections for stress testing
- **Error Conditions**: Network failures, API limits, etc.

### Test Isolation

- **Temporary Databases**: Isolated SQLite instances

- **File System**: Temporary directories for caching
- **Network Isolation**: No external dependencies

## Best Practices

### Test Development

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
2. **Behavior Testing**: Focus on user-facing functionality
3. **Mock External Services**: Isolate from Discogs API
4. **Performance Awareness**: Monitor execution time
5. **Documentation**: Clear test descriptions and comments

### Maintenance

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies current
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track test execution time
3. **Coverage Goals**: Maintain 80%+ code coverage
4. **Flaky Test Detection**: Identify and fix unstable tests
5. **Documentation**: Update test documentation with changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tests fail with import errors**
```bash
# Ensure dependencies are installed
pip install -r test-requirements.txt
```

**Docker tests fail**
```bash
# Verify Docker is running
docker --version
docker ps
```

**Performance tests timeout**
```bash
# Run without slow tests
python3 -m pytest -m "not slow"
```

**Database conflicts**
```bash
# Clean test artifacts
make clean
```

### Support

For testing issues or questions:

1. Check test output logs for specific errors
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure Docker is available for deployment tests
4. Review test configuration in `pytest.ini`
5. Run individual test categories to isolate issues
