  2. Monitor test execution time and optimize slow tests

🚀 QUICK START GUIDE
------------------------------
  1. Install dependencies: pip install -r test-requirements.txt
  2. Run all tests: python3 run_tests.py
  3. Run specific category: make test-unit
  4. Generate coverage: make coverage
  5. Docker tests: make docker-test
  6. Deployment check: make deployment-check

🔧 TEST EXECUTION COMMANDS
------------------------------
  All tests           : python3 run_tests.py
  Unit tests only     : python3 -m pytest tests/unit -v
  Integration tests   : python3 -m pytest tests/integration -v
  Performance tests   : python3 -m pytest tests/performance -v
